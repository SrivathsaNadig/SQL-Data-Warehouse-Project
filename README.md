# PORTFOLIO PROJECT : Data Warehouse And Analytics

Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server.

The data was extracted from the source CSV files in the bronze layer, cleaned and transformed in silver layer and made presentable to the client
in the gold layer.

The project was a good exposure to the various important functions available in SSMS SQL.
I was able to implement the SQL commands that were required.

A great experience following Data With Baraa
